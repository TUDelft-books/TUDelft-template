# Exercise: Deploy Book Workflow

The **Deploy Book Workflow (DBW)** automatically builds and publishes your TeachBook whenever changes are pushed to your repository. If you started your book from the TeachBooks Template, this workflow is already included. 

With this workflow, readers can see your latest book version online without manual intervention. This exercise will guide you through triggering the workflow, configuring branch-specific builds, and customising deployment options.

::::::{topic} Exercise objective
Can you trigger, configure, and monitor the Deploy Book Workflow to publish your TeachBook automatically?
::::::



## Trigger the workflow

1. Make a small edit in any page of your book (for example `book/intro.md`).
2. Commit the change and push it to the `main` branch.
3. Open the **Actions** tab of your repository. You should see a workflow called *Deploy Book* running.
4. When it finishes, visit the URL:

   ````
   https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/
   ````

   to see the updated book.


5. The workflow can also be triggered in a separate branch. Create a new branch, e.g., `draft-chapter`.
6. Push a change to this branch.
7. The DBW automatically builds a version of your book for that branch, available at:

   ````
   https://<username>.github.io/<repository-name>/draft-chapter/
   ````

```{tip}
Branch-specific builds are useful for previewing work in progress without affecting the main book.
