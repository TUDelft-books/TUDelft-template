# TeachBooks Favourites

The **TeachBooks-Favourites** extension brings together TeachBooks’ most-used and most-loved features in one convenient package. It bundles several Sphinx extensions—developed both by TeachBooks and others—into a single install, making it easier to start a new TeachBook with all recommended functionality already enabled.

This exercise will guide you through installing the **TeachBooks-Favourites** extension, enabling it in your configuration, and exploring what it includes.

## Install the extension

If you’re working in a custom or manually configured repository, follow these steps to install it.

1. Install the package using `pip`:

   ```
   pip install git+https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-Favourites
   ```

2. Add it to your `requirements.txt`:

   ```
   git+https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-Favourites
   ```

3. Enable it in `_config.yml`:

   ```yaml
   sphinx:
     extra_extensions:
       - teachbooks_favourites
   ```

4. Commit and rebuild your book — all favourite extensions will now load automatically with their default settings.

```{tip}
If you’re using GitHub online only (without local installation), simply edit your `_config.yml` and `requirements.txt` files directly in the browser, then commit. The next automatic build will include the extension.
```

## Customising your favourites

5. If you want to use only some of the included extensions, you can remove `teachbooks_favourites` from `_config.yml` and instead add the specific extensions you need. This gives you full control over which features are loaded. Try this out with the example below:

```yaml
sphinx:
  extra_extensions:
    - sphinx_image_inverter
    - sphinx_iframes
    - teachbooks_sphinx_tippy
```


```{tip}
Start with `teachbooks_favourites` enabled — it’s a great default for beginners. As your project grows, you can refine which extensions stay active.
```

## Contribute your favourite

6. Think an extension deserves a place among the favourites? You can contribute by opening an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/TeachBooks/TeachBooks-Favourites), or submitting a **pull request** that adds it to:

  * `README.md`
  * `pyproject.toml`
  * `src/teachbooks_favourites/__init__.py`

```{note}
Extensions must be stable, open-source, and enhance the TeachBooks authoring or learning experience.
```

7. When you are ready, commit your changes to the repository by clicking on the green `Commit changes` button.

8. Add a commit message.

9. To see your changes, go to {octicon}`play` **Actions** → select the most recent workflow run → wait for it to finish → click the link under *Branches deployed* and *Primary book at root*.

10. Don’t see your change? Press `CTRL+F5` / `Control+F5` to refresh the page.
